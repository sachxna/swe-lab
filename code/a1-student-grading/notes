= todo  for the project
===== VERY VERY IMPORTANT (knowledge/try new)

thoughts and notes about the project while making it:

Assignment 1:
- learnt that to us sscanf,i would need the buffer size to be explicitly allocated, as opposed to char *var -> seg fault because where is sscanf writing to? 
- chose to allocate statically -> sub_name[64]
- need to free memory
- need to add error checking
- why const char?
- check for both null and empty string -> they are not the same
- note: accept spaces in name
- float division should be x/100.f to make it true float div
- goto function for early returns

Assignment 2:
- cohesion -> how well the things within a module will work together; so like if funcitons within a header file have high cohesion, which is preferred -> they work well to achieve a common goal
- coupling -> how are modules interconnected with each other; so is parse.h dependent on say, computation.h? lower the coupling, the better -> changes in one module shouldnt affect another module
= so now, need to separate the functions into headers and files such that -> low coupling and high cohesion
= user defined header files are already made -> refine it: is it reusable?
= usability of the software is low -> no GUI for the software; but there are relevant error messages that pop up when needed; maybe refine this too? 
= check algorithm complexity + memory allocation for student details
===== TRY INVOCATION OF THE FUNCTIONS OVER THE NETWORK!!!=====
- documentation using draw.io for uml diagrams? why uml -> standard modelling language, used to develop visual models for the processes within a system.
= learn uml and how it is used for documentation purposes -> what is better: logic/algorithms or diagram?
= write module specification for the different modules -> name, input, pre condition, logic & output
= test plan for project -> use the file given to do actual testing


todo:
T1: --
T2: 
	- modularisation
	- change the input logic for students: why use predefined number of students per file? either specify that youre taking n students and parse as if only so many per file -> bad idea/ dynamically figure out?
