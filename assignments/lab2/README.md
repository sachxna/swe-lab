Lab 2: Student Result Processing System

In Lab 2, we're aiming to modularise the code implemented for Lab 1, and improving the aspects of the project such as: 

Modularisation:
	Aiming to modularise the code to decrease the coupling between modules while having the functions of a module have high cohesion.

Quality Characteristics (Usability, Efficiency,Reusability, etc):
	Improve the UI of the system -> print appropriate error messages, improve resource usage, etc.

Documentation:
	Write the module specification each module, and draw a dependency diagram/logic diagram for each of them.
	
Test Plans:
	Write a test plan for each of the functions and store the test report.

Notes:

- Inside docs/ , module_spec.md gives the interaction and the control flow of the functions within the application.
- /data holds the input and the output file. modify here to run your file.
- /src holds the source code for the project
- /include holds all the header files that are required by the files in /src
- a flowchart diagram is also present in /docs

Execution:

- To run the program, use 'make' to build the apllication, and run with './student_system'
- the output for the computations will be present in /data as 'output.txt
